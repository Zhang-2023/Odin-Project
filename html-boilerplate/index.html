        Hello Odin!
        <p>I am currently testing how paragraphs work in html</p>
        <p>This is the second paragragh</p>
        <p>Be sure to remember that there are only 6 headers h1-h6</p>
        <p><strong>By using strong it will bold words</strong><em>While em will make the words
            italisized em stands for emphasied</em></p>
            <!-- This how comments are written in html-->
            <!--<b> and <i> can also be used to bold and italicize text however they only change the 
                visual representation of the word and not the metadata of the words (meaning that it 
                is still recognized as normal words but look bold on italicized)-->
